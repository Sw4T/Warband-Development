# Warband-Development

_Actually developping_ : **Truand Brawl** - A MP Mod for Mount&Blade Warband where you fight with many differents classes, weapons and stuff but in a totally random way. We're aiming to release a version with deathmatch implemented over little maps and some basic random stuff like positioning or weapons.

##How to get involved and/or play the mod ?

1. Download Python 2.7.X and add ";C:/Python27" (or your install path) to the PATH variable of Windows 
2. Get the module system directory from this repository and copy it where you want
3. Change the variable _export_dir_ of the file _module_info.py_ to the path of your choice (it will be your mod folder)
4. Execute _compile.bat_ to compile all your files into the new mod folder
5. To play it, just put your mod folder in your M&B Warband/Modules directory and run it on Mount&Blade:Warband

We are using the native module system to create the mod and some tools :
- [openBRF](http://www.mbrepository.com/file.php?id=1466) - Open .brf files to preview/import/exports everything like meshes, textures...
- [Morghs M&B WB-WFAS Editor](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cC2UVnQXdsMFxt7PepGbCWtNcOau4CiA/view) - GUI to add/edit troops, items, parties...
- [MABLE](http://www.mbrepository.com/file.php?id=2659) - GUI to edit module_items.py
